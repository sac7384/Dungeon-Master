    //Player Menu
    System.out.println("Now that you've seen your stats, I'm gonna show you the player menu.");
    System.out.println("From the player menu you can look at the stats screen you just saw, see the stats of your equipment, access your inventory, and access your skill tree.");
    System.out.println("I'll go ahead and explain everything to you and then you can poke around in the player menu to see everything for yourself. Remember that you can always scroll up and read through my explanation while you peruse the menu.");
    System.out.println("Oops, I broke the fourth wall again didn't I? This is why I keep getting fired... Forget I said any of that okay? And please don't tell my boss.");
    //Equipment
    System.out.println("The first option in the player menu is your stats which you have already seen. The second option show you the stats of your equipment. This will show you your currently equipped weapon, artifact, scroll, and armor.");
    System.out.println("Your the first three are very similar. Each one is used for attacking enemies and uses a different stat. Your weapon uses the Strength stat, your artifact uses the Craftiness stat, and your scroll uses your Focus stat.");
    System.out.println("Your armor defends against damage but is not specific to any one stat. It will reduce damage from all sources.");
    System.out.println("Your attacking equipment has the same stats: a name, an element, and damage. Some special items will give you extra stat boosts to Health, Strength, Critical Hit Chance, etc. When you look at your stats these bonuses will be taken into account.");
    System.out.println("Your equipment's damage is represented by a range of values. When you attack with your weapon it will deal a random number of damage between those two numbers(inclusive)");
    System.out.println("The element tells you what type of damage your weapon will deal. If an enemy is weak to your weapon's element you will deal double damage. Enter any number to continue.");
    scan.nextInt();
    //Inventory
    System.out.println("The inventory is where you will store all your items. From there you can equip your weapons, artifacts, scrolls, and armor. You can also use other items like healing potions.");
    System.out.println("Battle items can't be used from the player menu. No drinking dangerous potions! When you first select an item you will see its description, then you can decide to use it or not.");
    System.out.println("Hmmm? How large is your inventory? Infinite! You can store as many items as you would like in there. That's unrealistic? Dwendra is a world filled with crazy magic and creatures that can all sorts of unimaginable things. EVERYTHING is 'unrealistic' here.");
    System.out.println("Right now you won't have anything in your inventory but once you get an item you can check that out. Any number to continue.");
    scan.nextInt();
    //Skill Tree
    System.out.println("Now to skills trees. You have six of them. Two for each main stat. Each of these pairs is made of one tree that is more offensively focused and one that is more defensively focused.");
    System.out.println("The first one in the pair is always the offensive one and the second is always the defensive one. The Knight trees are Strength focused, the Rogue trees are Craftiness focused, and the Mage trees are Focus focused. Huh, 'Focus focused'.");
    System.out.println("When you upgrade a skill from these trees you will increase the stat that tree is focused on by however many skill points you spent.");
    System.out.println("Each tree is structured the same way. They each have four tiers with skills that get better with each tier. The cost of each skill is the same as the tier it is in. In the first two tiers there are two options to choose from.");
    System.out.println("The first option will increase one of your stats and the second will give you a skill that will help you in battle. Some of those skills are passive and are used automatically and some have to be activated yourself. Acitve skills have a (Active) before its description.");
    System.out.println("Tier three and four only have one option. Tier three's option increases your stats and Tier four gives you that tree's signtature skill. Signature skills are specific to that tree's battle strategy and are the best skills in the game.");
    System.out.println("Right now you can only see the tier one skills but you will unlock the others by spending points in that tree. Once you have spent five points (the maximum for any one skill) in a tier you will unlock the next tier.");
    System.out.println("The last option is to look at your active quests. I'll get to that in a bit.");
    System.out.println("Go ahead and read all that then you can check out the player menu.");

    //Battle
    System.out.println("Alright... guess I should tell you about how to kill stuff now. So I guess we can just walk around and find something weak to fight. I'll explain how battling works while you find something to ruthlessly murder.");
    System.out.println("So when the fight starts your stats will be desplaid along with the enemy's health and three base stats. Your options will be able to do a basic attack with one of your three weapons, use a skill, use an item from your inventory, or surrender.");
    System.out.println("You have one weapon for each main stat. Your Weapon deals Strength damage, your Artifact deals Craftiness damage, your Scroll deals Focus damage. Your skills are obtained from skill trees. If a skill stays active there will be a '(Active)' next to it once it is activated.");
    System.out.println("Items in your inventory can be used during battle to deal damage, heal yourself, or leave effects on the battlefield. Once you use an item it will be used up. Only logical.");
    System.out.println("The last option is to escape. This will end your expedition and return you to Tyrnel. There is a catch though, the enemy will get a hit on you before you can escape. So make sure you have decent health before you run away.");
    System.out.println("Well that just about wraps up the battle menu. Found any small innocent creature to mutilate? AWWWWWW HE'S SO CUTE. It's the most Adorable Cute Fluffy Tiny Little Rabbit ever! Do you have to kill him? I'd love to keep him as a pet... *sigh* okay then... Enter a number to progress... I guess.");
